In front-end side I used ReactJS and to be able to interact with the blockchain from client side I used Ethers.js library.

All the metadata of the NFTs are stored in IPFS. This project is live now check it out here : metapilotsnft.com",

      "description": "In this Web 3.0 project, I created a simple dapp that uses Ethereum blockchain. The dapp was deployed on Rinkeby testnet with hardhat. Smart Contract was written in Solidity. In the front-end, I used React and to connect to the blockchain I used Ethers.js which is an alternative to Web3.js. Metamask is the provider in this dapp. After connecting your wallet with Metamask, you enter a message which will be stored in the blockchain, hitting the wave button is going to trigger Metamask to confirm your transaction. If you refresh the page after your transaction was mined, you will see your message which was fetched from the blockchain. You will also see other messages that were sent by other wallets.",
